# Fakr
A library for generating fake data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers in Golang

This package / library is a port of Ruby Faker gem by stympy which was a port of Perl's Data::Faker library that generates fake data.

This package comes in very handy for project mockups, such as having real-looking test data, and having your database populated with more than one or two records while you're doing development.
